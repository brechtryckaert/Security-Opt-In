# Security-Opt-In
A WordPress plugin to create opt-in functionalities to propose for core inclusion. 

## What it'll do

By turning on this plugin, following features of WordPress will be instantly deactivated:
- the XML-RPC-protocol
- Author Pages

Both settings are on by default in a vanilla WordPress install but can be abused for hacking purposes. 

## What I'd like to accomplish

By using this plugin, the features listed above become "opt-in" function, meaning you can turn them on if needed, but by default they are disabled. This way I hope to create a more secure WordPress experience.

Please note that this plugin is still under development and not production ready.
